# Fundamentals

## Telemetry
Describes what your systems is doing. A systems will emit Telemetry.

## Signals
A Signal is a particular **form** of Telemetry, in that it is a piece of data that takes a well know format e.g. a piece of data that take the form of a Trace.

There are different **kinds** of Signals which have well know use cases. For an example:
* System event logs
* Infrastructure metrics
* Client and server spans

With these general kinds of Signals you have **types** which define the data specification or implementation. An example of this is a metric type of counter or gauge.
