Each **pillar** of Observability comprises of:

## 1. Instrumentation

Instrumentation is the process of enabling your application to **emit** telemetry.

Rather than just collecting existing data, instrumentation is about **generating** new data - **Signals**.

## 2. Data Formatting

The process of structuring the generated **Telemetry** into a standard specification.

## 3. Data Transmission

The mechanism of moving **Telemetry** from the system to a remote system.

## 4. Analysis

Hopefully come to a conclusion on why a system behaving like soe, or open the door for further analysis.
