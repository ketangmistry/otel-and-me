# Systems

## Cloud Native

The software run-time is the **Application** and the platform it runs on is the **System**. There maybe some fuzziness where they meet e.g. the Java process running within a container running within a Pod running within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Pipelines

Pipelines act as the **connective tissue** between applications and systems.

- **Delivery Pipelines**: These belong to the **System**. They define the automated path that an **Application** takes to be deployed into the environment.
- **Telemetry Pipelines**: These are part of the **System** infrastructure. They receive the data generated by the **Application** and transmit them for analysis.
